# GPT-4 Fact Checking with Search Engine Integration

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to implement fact checking with OpenAI's GPT-4 language model. The code utilizes search engine integration with Bing and Google to gather multiple answers for a given query and compare them with the answer generated by GPT-4. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of GPT-4 responses by fact-checking the information provided.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (can be installed via `pip install requests`)
- Bing Search API key (Sign up for an API key [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-search-api-v7))
- Google Custom Search API key and Custom Search Engine ID (Create a Custom Search Engine [here](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/creatingcse) and obtain an API key [here](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction))

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Replace the placeholder values for the Bing API key, Google API key, and Custom Search Engine ID in the code.

   ```python
   # Replace these placeholder values with your actual API keys
   google_params = {
       'key': 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY',
       'cx': 'YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID',
       ...
   }
   ```

4. Implement the `gpt4_generate_answer()` function to generate answers using GPT-4 based on your preferred method.

   ```python
   def gpt4_generate_answer(question):
       # Implement your code to generate the answer using GPT-4
       ...
       return generated_answer
   ```

5. Run the code and provide a user query to fact-check the GPT-4 answer.

   ```shell
   python fact_check.py
   ```
